					<p>The game of basketball is constantly changing. The style of play evolves over time, and this causes changes in the way basketball is played professionally. In my <a href="https://andrew601.github.io/WebScraping.html">previous post</a>, I talked about how I wanted to look at how offense has changed in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and, more specifically, why are so many more points are being scored than ever before in the history of the NBA. I decided that the best way to answer this question was to look at shot data for NBA players from the previous year and from 20 years ago, as well as league stats over those years. This analysis will dive into my question using real data to find answers and come to conclusions.</p>

        
					<h3>Shooting Heat Maps</h3>
					<div class="image fit">
						<img src="images/Heatmaps.png" alt="Image of a heat maps" class="wrap-image" />
					</div>

					<p>To better answer my question, I broke it down into a few different parts. The first part was to look at the shooting patterns of the two chosen seasons. If we could map where the shots are being taken, it might give us an idea of why scoring has increased so much. Using the coordinate data that I collected, I was able to create heat maps of the two seasons, showing where the most shots were being taken. Looking at the 2002–2003 map, we can make a few observations. There is a huge concentration of shots taken directly in front of the basketball hoop; next, we see a fairly even distribution of shots everywhere else on the court. This might appear normal, but when compared side by side to the 2022–2023 map, we see clear differences. First, there is more variance in shots taken close to the basket, but there is still a large concentration of very close shots. This is important to note because these are high-percentage shots, meaning they go in more than any other type of shot. Second, we notice a dead zone spanning a few feet in front of the 3-point line. The 3-point shot has influenced the game so much, especially with players such as Stephen Curry being known for shooting it often and well. These shots right in front of the 3-point line are called “long distance 2's,” meaning they are only worth 2 points, but they are far from the basket, meaning they are shot at a much lower percentage. Since 2002, this area has become a dead zone for shooters in the NBA.</p>


					<h3>Distribution of Shot Distance</h3>
					<div class="image fit">
						<img src="images/Histogram.png" alt="Image of shot distance histogram" class="wrap-image" />
					</div>
					
					<p>We can take a further look at this by plotting a histogram that shows the distribution of shots for the two seasons. Looking at the histogram, we see that although more shots were taken from 0 feet in 2002, the overall total from the 0–5 foot range is much higher in 2022. This confirms that more high-percentage shots are being taken now than before. Next, we can visualize the difference in the number of “long-distance 2’s” being taken. In 2002, we see a peak on the histogram of shots being taken around 19 feet, a low percentage shot only worth 2 points. Finally, we see slightly more 3-pointers being shot in total in 2022 than in 2002. It is important to note that while 3-pointers are shot at a much lower percentage than all other shots, the benefit of rewarding an extra point pays off and gives teams more points overall. Looking at this histogram, we might start to wonder what the difference in shot type selection between the two seasons is.</p>


					<div class="image fit">
						<img src="images/Piecharts.png" alt="Image of shot type percentage pie charts" class="wrap-image" />
					</div>
					
					<p>This pie chart shows the percentages of shots being taken from in front of and behind the 3-point line. In 2002, close to 1 out of every 5 shots was a 3-pointer. By 2022, this number will have increased to about 1 in every 4. It is important to recognize that this data only accounts for the top scorers of each season, so to better understand this, I created graphs that show the league-wide totals for shooting.</p>


					<h3>League Shooting over time</h3>
					<div class="image fit">
						<img src="images/Linegraphs.png" alt="Image of shot line graphs for league" class="wrap-image" />
					</div>

					<p>Looking at these line graphs, we see that the total number of field goals, meaning any shot taken during the game that was a free throw, remained fairly constant, only increasing from about 80 to a little over 85 total shots per game, and the number of made field goals increasing from just below 40 to a little above. However, looking at the 3-pointer line graph, we see a different story. The total number of three-pointers has increased from about 15 to 35, with the total number of made 3-pointers increasing from about 5 to 12. What this tells us is that roughly the same number of shots are being taken per game, but that more of those shots have become 3-pointers, which, like we said earlier, pays off in the long run by rewarding an extra point.</p>

				
					<h3>Conclusion</h3>
					<p>This data tells us so much about the game of basketball and its evolution over the last two decades. We can now answer our question of how the game of basketball has changed offensively. It is clear that the number of high-percentage, close-to-the basket shots has increased significantly, meaning more scoring. We also see a change in the shooting patterns of players in the NBA, with the development of a dead zone where shots are made at a much lower percentage. We also see that the 3-point shot has become a valuable asset to players and has increased in usage over the last 20 years. The modern NBA is full of skilled players, and now more than ever, it requires players to be able to score at multiple levels, including close to the basket and far from it. While this data tells us a story, there is so much more to be learned. We could look at shot distribution by position or look at a distribution of percentages by distance to calculate where the optimal shot should be. If you are still interested in this, I have created an <a href="https://andrew601-stat-386-project-app-bdouts.streamlit.app">interactive app</a> that displays a dashboard of all these graphs for you to view and play around with. I will also include a link to my <a href="https://github.com/Andrew601/Stat-386-Project">GitHub repository</a> with all my code for collecting and cleaning the data, as well as the datasets I created. I hope my findings helped increase your understanding of basketball and the NBA, and I encourage you to use data to find answers to your own questions, just like I was able to with my own questions.</p>
